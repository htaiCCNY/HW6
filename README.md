HW 6--Project group: Holli, Liam, Kseniia

Our current subject is focusing on health expenditure, health outcomes, and how different economic/social indicators may also affect health outcomes based on the amount spent on healthcare. I found international articles that seemed prevalent to the initial idea on the CCNY library journal site, but we are trying to find better data/studies for NYC urban health indicators

The first article: . In a study of the Sub Saharan African region (Arthur, & Oaikhenan, H. E. (2017)) research found that despite increased efforts in  private and public healthcare expenditure, health outcomes only increased marginally in response. In the paper, they used descriptive analysis and the health production function. Data was sourced from the World Bank "World Development Indicators".

Second article: 3. In a study of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), research found that there was no direct, significant relationship between increased health care expenditure and life expectancy in the region, but there was a statistically significant effect on increased total healthcare expenditure and decreased crude death and infant mortality rates. This study uses World Bank data set for 15 countries, over a 20 year period. A panel data
analysis was conducted. (Rahman, Khanam, R., & Rahman, M. (2018). Health care expenditure and health outcome nexus: new evidence from the SAARC-ASEAN region. Globalization and Health)
